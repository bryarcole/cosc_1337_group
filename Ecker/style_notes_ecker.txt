Observations:

There should be a space between those function declarations and the main function.

Uneccessary spaces should be avoided (i.e. extra lines.)

Variable names should be done in 'snake-case'
for example:
	'hoursremain'
	should be:
	'hours_remain'
	instead, for readability.

One other thing, functions should be contained in a file, such as 'myfile.h'
make sure to use the .h extension (as a convention). Then just include the 
header file. Then inside your main functin, you can have just a series of 
function calls. In this way it is easier to manage the structure of your 
program, and at the same time you get the advantage of being able to reuse 
your code (all those functions you just wrote will become usable functions 
for future programs.)

I think we should include it as one of our own standards. What do you guys 
think? And, either camel-case or snake-case (my preference is snake) but one or 
the other and not both.

I am fine with the convention of beginning a block of code on the same line,
and the having the ending curly-bracket on its own line at the end of the
block.
